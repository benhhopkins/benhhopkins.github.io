Made for Ludum Dare 41. The theme was to combine two incompatible genres. Here, "RTS" with side-view shmup controls. If you can resist cheesing and dropping on the enemy base, it's a pretty fun marine-micro simulator. I'm happy with the tiny sprite style. I used the Phaser framework, which I've found to be great for simple web games.
