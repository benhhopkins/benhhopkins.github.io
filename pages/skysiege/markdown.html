<p>Thanks to Chase Bethea for the music and sfx!</p>
<p>It was my first time using the <a href="Phaser.io">Phaser</a> game engine, and I really enjoyed it. It’s easy to work with, well designed, and well-established with lots of examples and answered questions. The level of abstraction is just right for me. It’s all programming without any clunky UI, but it makes loading and using assets very easy and provides a minimal framework for control flow. It’ll definitely be my go-to for game jams going forward.</p>
<p>This game jam was a longer one, spanning across two weekends, but I ended up having a busy week and only really worked on the game for two and a half days. Some features had to be cut – originally I wanted clouds to roll by that you could hide in and dash out of as a special attack vector. It would have been cool to have more visual debris when opponents explode and maybe some minimal background elements.</p>
<p>Overall I like how the visual and gameplay aesthetics turned out, so I’ll probably revisit this in the future.</p>
<p>Here’s the <a href="https://github.com/benhhopkins/skysiege">source</a>. Fair warning, it was my first time using Phaser and I don’t do a ton of JS development!</p>
