<p>Malagris was initally developed in two weeks for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/trick-or-treat-jam">Trick or Treat Jam</a>. We ended up with a pretty large team! I led the project and did the coding, level design, art direction, and sound effects. Please check the full list of contributors on the itch.io page. In particular I want to shout out <a href="https://roskovair.itch.io/">Rosko Vair</a> for making a huge, amazing soundtrack, and <a href="https://lowlande52.itch.io/">Richard Klassen</a> for being something of an executive producer and making some critial 3d models.</p>
