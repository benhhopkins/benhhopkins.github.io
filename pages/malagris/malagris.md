Malagris is a PSX-style horror/puzzle game. You're tasked with solving a mystery on a Victorian estate while being stalked by a powerful demon.

Malagris was initally developed in two weeks for the [Trick or Treat Jam](https://itch.io/jam/trick-or-treat-jam). We ended up with a pretty large team! I led the project and did the coding, level design, art direction, and sound effects. Please check the full list of contributors on the itch.io page. In particular I want to shout out [Rosko Vair](https://roskovair.itch.io/) for making a huge, amazing soundtrack, and [Richard Klassen](https://lowlande52.itch.io/) for being something of an executive producer and making some critial 3d models.
