Made in about half a week for Ludum Dare 46. A lightly satirical shooter where you use a variety of odd weapons to defend you family from the hogs. It was fun to integrate the slick [EzySlice](https://github.com/DavidArayan/ezy-slice) framework for destructable objects. It was a mistake to try to use some Unity frameworks that were in preview, and I blew past all the jam deadlines.

Made with Unity, Blender, and Sunvox.
