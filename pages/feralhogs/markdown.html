<p>Made in about half a week for Ludum Dare 46. A lightly satirical shooter where you use a variety of odd weapons to defend you family from the hogs. It was fun to integrate the slick <a href="https://github.com/DavidArayan/ezy-slice">EzySlice</a> framework for destructable objects. It was a mistake to try to use some Unity frameworks that were in preview, and I blew past all the jam deadlines.</p>
<p>Made with Unity, Blender, and Sunvox.</p>
