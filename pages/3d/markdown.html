<p>Playing around with isometric perspective. Camera is angled at (60, 0, 45), and the film pixel filter width is 0.01px to get those sharp pixel edges.<br>

Generating looks similar to pixel art from 3D is appealing to me. I'd like to make a game in a similar style someday.</p>

We were going for a bit of a claymation style. These are captured from Unity, where I made a simple shader that uses 3d noise to adjust color and vertex displacement every few frames. I used constant interpolation in the animations and limited keyframes to every 3-6 frames, though I think next time I would exaggerate the stop-motion look with even fewer keyframes.</p>
