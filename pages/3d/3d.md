# Other 3d stuff


![House](./media/house.png) {.media-fixed-scale}

Playing around with isometric perspective. Camera is angled at (60, 0, 45), and the film pixel filter width is 0.01px to get those sharp pixel edges.

Generating looks similar to pixel art from 3D is appealing to me. I'd like to make a game in a similar style someday.

Tube TV enemy for a gamejam.  
Some other enemies, rigged and animated:  
[cat slime](./media/cat.webm)
[floater](./media/floater.webm)
[rolling eye](./media/eye.webm)  
(these 3 designed by Sammy Mahmoudi, and modelled by Richard Klassen)  
We were going for a bit of a claymation style. These are captured from Unity, where I made a simple shader that uses 3d noise to adjust color and vertex displacement every few frames. I used constant interpolation in the animations and limited keyframes to every 3-6 frames, though I think next time I would exaggerate the stop-motion look with even fewer keyframes.
