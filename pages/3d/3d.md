# Other 3d stuff

<div class="sidebar-container">

Playing around with isometric perspective. Camera is angled at (60, 0, 45), and the film pixel filter width is 0.01px to get those sharp pixel edges.

It's satisfying to render 3d models with the clean lines of pixel art. I'd like to make a game in a similar style someday.

Tube TV enemy for a gamejam.  
Some other enemies that I rigged and animated:  
[cat slime](./media/cat.webm)
[floater](./media/floater.webm)
[rolling eye](./media/eye.webm)  
(above 3 designed by Sammy Mahmoudi, and modelled by Richard Klassen)  
We were going for a claymation style. These are captured from Unity, where I made a simple shader that uses 3d noise to adjust color and vertex displacement every few frames. I used constant interpolation in the animations and limited keyframes to every 3-6 frames. Next time I would exaggerate the stop-motion look with even fewer keyframes.
