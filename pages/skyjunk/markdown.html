<p>Skyjunk is an in-development roguelite third-person shooter with action emphasizing movement across procedurally generated levels. I'm aiming for a super clean early-3d retro arcade aesthetic and gameplay that's fast and fluid. The game is inspired by the mechanics of titles like Risk of Rain 2, but with a focus on fewer characters, more detailed movesets, and more variation per run with procedural generation. I'm also looking to incorporate some of my favorite strategic elements from non-action roguelites such as Slay the Spire.</p>
<p>Skyjunk was originally developed with my friend Aaron Gorenstein for the GitHub Game Off 2020 jam. It placed 7th out of 500+ entries and people seemed to enjoy it quite a bit!</p>
