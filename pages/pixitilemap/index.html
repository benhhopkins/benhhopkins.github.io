Draggable, Zoomable Tile Map with Pixi.js Below is a post from my old blog that people found useful and was removed when
I updated this site. Click here to check it out! GitHub Source Pixi.js is a lightweight 2D webGL renderer, which I’ve been
learning to use to make simple HTML5 games. Pixi.js is often listed as a Javascript game “engine”, but I like using it because
it is only a rendering engine, offering you more flexibility in how the whole project is designed. Plus, it’s really fast.
In this post, I’m going to review my solution to making a “Tilemap” class that extends Pixi.js objects. This goes a little
beyond most Pixi.js tutorials I’ve read, and I think it shows an elegant (and intended) way of integrating the library with
your projects. I started creating this tilemap because I was interested in making a simple Civilization-like game that runs
in the browser. I think the class I ended up with could be suitable for any type of game or application that uses discrete
tiles. The class extends the basic Pixi.js classes for sprites and groups of sprites (Sprite and DisplayObjectContainer).
A brief rundown on the classes/files used in the demo: main.js – Sets up and returns the Pixi renderer, loads the sprites,
and initializes the tilemap + menu. tilemap.js – Defines a Tilemap object that extends Pixi’s DisplayObjectContainer. The
rest of this post details the specifics of this class. menu.js – Defines a simple Menu object that also extends DisplayObjectContainer.
Contains buttons for zooming the map and displays the coordinates of the currently selected tile. tiles.json and tiles.png
– The sprites and data for loading them. See here for a tutorial that covers loading Pixi sprites like this. I am going to
write this post from the point of view of someone who has a basic understanding of Pixi.js. I’d recommend checking out the
basics and possibly other resources if you don’t already know about it. With that said, let me explain the Tilemap class.
We do the following to extend the DisplayObjectContainer: Tilemap.prototype = new PIXI.DisplayObjectContainer(); Tilemap.prototype.constructor
= Tilemap; There are a number of ways to implement inheritance in JavaScript. This way is fairly straightforward and there
is a good tutorial here. By inheriting from DisplayObjectContainer, we can add our Tilemap object directly to the Pixi Stage
for drawing, and inherited methods and properties won’t need to be duplicated. It also makes sense because the tiles added
to the map are also Pixi sprites, and we can store them inside the DisplayObjectContainer’s array of children. All of this
is set up in the Tilemap constructor. function Tilemap(width, height){ PIXI.DisplayObjectContainer.call(this); this.interactive
= true; this.tilesWidth = width; this.tilesHeight = height; this.tileSize = 16; this.zoom = 2; this.scale.x = this.scale.y
= this.zoom; this.startLocation = { x: 0, y: 0 }; // fill the map with tiles this.generateMap(); By calling the DisplayObjectContainer
constructor on this, the Tilemap object we are constructing now is initialized as it’s Pixi parent. We set the inherited
property interactive = true so the container will receive mouse and touch events. tilesWidth and tilesHeight are used to
store the dimensions of the map (as opposed to width and height which are properties of the parent object and track the pixel
dimensions). tileSize is the width and height of a single tile in pixels and will be used in many calculations. zoom tracks
the zoom level of the map, and anywhere this is changed the inherited property scale is also changed in the x and y dimensions
to properly scale the displayed sprites. startLocation will be set later to track the location of a hypothetical player’s
starting village if this tilemap was used in a game. generateMap() is called to fill the map with tiles. The key part of
interfacing with Pixi here is in the addTile,changeTile, and getTile methods. Tilemap.prototype.addTile = function(x, y,
terrain){ var tile = PIXI.Sprite.fromFrame(terrain); tile.position.x = x * this.tileSize; tile.position.y = y * this.tileSize;
tile.tileX = x; tile.tileY = y; tile.terrain = terrain; this.addChildAt(tile, x * this.tilesHeight + y); } Tilemap.prototype.changeTile
= function(x, y, terrain){ this.removeChild(this.getTile(x, y)); this.addTile(x, y, terrain); } Tilemap.prototype.getTile
= function(x, y){ return this.getChildAt(x * this.tilesHeight + y); } As mentioned earlier, each tile is in fact just a Pixi
sprite with a few extra properties. This allows us to add the tiles as children of the Tilemap which is a DisplayObjectContainer,
and avoid duplicating the map data in any way. As long as we use the addTile, changeTile, and getTile methods, this optimization
is nicely encapsulated. generateMap uses these methods to fill all valid tile locations with tiles, create landmasses with
varied tile types, and find a start location for the player. The algorithm for shaping the land is simple — a random point
on the map is chosen to spawn land of a certain “height”, and then the process is recursively called on random neighboring
tiles with a reduced height. I’m pleased that, just by calling this simple method on a number of points, interesting continents
and shapes can be formed. World creation isn’t the purpose of this post so I’ll leave it at that, but I look forward to exploring
it more in the future. After the map is generated, we return to the Tilemap constructor where the inherited callback methods
for reacting to mouse and touch events will be set up. // variables and functions for moving the map this.mouseoverTileCoords
= [0, 0]; this.selectedTileCoords = [0, 0]; this.mousePressPoint = [0, 0]; this.selectedGraphics = new PIXI.Graphics(); this.mouseoverGraphics
= new PIXI.Graphics(); this.addChild(this.selectedGraphics); this.addChild(this.mouseoverGraphics); Above are some declarations
that will be used for scrolling and selecting. The mouseoverTileCoords andselectedTileCoords properties are used for tracking
the moused-over and selected tiles, respectively. When the mouse is pressed on the map, mousePressPoint stores this position,
so that moving the mouse can scroll the map relative to the original position. The two Pixi graphics objects are used to
draw the selected and moused-over tile highlights. Coming from other types of graphics frameworks (especially ones where
you are directing the redrawing of the graphics every frame), it seemed a bit strange to need multiple graphics objects for
these tasks. But in the Pixi framework, clear() and drawing methods are used sparingly — only when you want to change the
display — and the frame-by-frame redraw is under the hood. Because of this, it makes sense to have a different graphics object
for each set of shapes that you’d like to clear separately. Now, we set the callback methods that Pixi will call during mouse
and touch events. this.mousedown = this.touchstart = function(data) { if(data.getLocalPosition(this.parent).x > menuBarWidth)
{ this.dragging = true; this.mousePressPoint[0] = data.getLocalPosition(this.parent).x - this.position.x; this.mousePressPoint[1]
= data.getLocalPosition(this.parent).y - this.position.y; this.selectTile(Math.floor(this.mousePressPoint[0] / (this.tileSize
* this.zoom)), Math.floor(this.mousePressPoint[1] / (this.tileSize * this.zoom))); } }; Clicking or touching the map will
set dragging = true so we know to scroll the map when the mouse or touch point is moved. We also want to store this point,
so we can scroll relative to it. The data argument passed in to this callback can provide us with the point information.
getLocalPosition is called with this.parent, which actually references the Pixi Stage which has this Tilemap object as a
child. This conversion is necessary to translate the absolute mouse or touch point into local coordinates for the Tilemap
object, whose position is defined relative to its parent. We callselectTile to update the graphics according to the tile
clicked or touched, taking into account the size of the tiles we are working with and the current zoom level to get the correct
tile coordinates. The code for drawing the graphical highlight is below. Tilemap.prototype.selectTile = function(x, y){ this.selectedTileCoords
= [x, y]; menu.selectedTileText.setText("Selected Tile: " + this.selectedTileCoords); this.selectedGraphics.clear(); this.selectedGraphics.lineStyle(2,
0xFFFF00, 1); this.selectedGraphics.beginFill(0x000000, 0); this.selectedGraphics.drawRect(this.selectedTileCoords[0] * this.tileSize,
this.selectedTileCoords[1] * this.tileSize, this.tileSize, this.tileSize); this.selectedGraphics.endFill(); } Back in the
Tilemap constructor, continuing to define touch callbacks… this.mouseup = this.mouseupoutside = this.touchend = this.touchendoutside
= function(data) { this.dragging = false; }; We want to make sure to end the dragging when any one of these events fires.
this.mousemove = this.touchmove = function(data) { if(this.dragging) { var position = data.getLocalPosition(this.parent);
this.position.x = position.x - this.mousePressPoint[0]; this.position.y = position.y - this.mousePressPoint[1]; this.constrainTilemap();
} else{ var mouseOverPoint = [0, 0]; mouseOverPoint[0] = data.getLocalPosition(this.parent).x - this.position.x; mouseOverPoint[1]
= data.getLocalPosition(this.parent).y - this.position.y; var mouseoverTileCoords = [Math.floor(mouseOverPoint[0] / (this.tileSize
* this.zoom)), Math.floor(mouseOverPoint[1] / (this.tileSize * this.zoom))]; this.mouseoverGraphics.clear(); this.mouseoverGraphics.lineStyle(1,
0xFFFFFF, 1); this.mouseoverGraphics.beginFill(0x000000, 0); this.mouseoverGraphics.drawRect( mouseoverTileCoords[0] * this.tileSize,
mouseoverTileCoords[1] * this.tileSize, this.tileSize - 1, this.tileSize - 1); this.mouseoverGraphics.endFill(); } }; When
the mouse or touch point moves, we want to scroll the map if we are clicking or holding down the touch. Otherwise, we draw
the mouseover graphical tile highlight. The latter is similar to the code for drawing the selected tile highlight. For dragging
or scrolling the map, we need to change the Tilemap’s position property (inherited from DisplayObjectContainer). We simply
want to change it to the difference between the original touched point and the current touched point. constrainTilemap is
called to make sure we aren’t dragging the map out of bounds of the viewport. That’s it for the Tilemap constructor. I want
to review the Tilemap’s zooming methods as well, which are called when the + and – buttons are clicked (defined in menu.js).
Tilemap.prototype.zoomIn = function(){ this.zoom = Math.min(this.zoom * 2, 8); this.scale.x = this.scale.y = this.zoom; this.centerOnSelectedTile();
this.constrainTilemap(); } Tilemap.prototype.zoomOut = function(){ this.mouseoverGraphics.clear(); this.zoom = Math.max(this.zoom
/ 2, 1); this.scale.x = this.scale.y = this.zoom; this.centerOnSelectedTile(); this.constrainTilemap(); } Tilemap.prototype.centerOnSelectedTile
= function(){ this.position.x = (renderWidth - menuBarWidth) / 2 - this.selectedTileCoords[0] * this.zoom * this.tileSize
- this.tileSize * this.zoom / 2 + menuBarWidth; this.position.y = renderHeight / 2 - this.selectedTileCoords[1] * this.zoom
* this.tileSize - this.tileSize * this.zoom / 2; } Both zooming methods are similar. Note that when zooming out, we want
to make sure to clear the mouseover graphics because the tile that was previously under the ‘-‘ button will be highlighted
when it is moved into view, and this highlight won’t be corrected until the mouse is moved. The zoom property is doubled
or halved for each zoom level, and the scale is set appropriately. The tricky calculation involved in zooming is in centerOnSelectedTile.
For computing the X position, (renderWidth - menuBarWidth) / 2 is half the width of the viewport on the Tilemap. Starting
from this center point, we move the over to the left to the position of the currently selected tile, - this.selectedTileCoords[0]
* this.zoom * this.tileSize and move a bit further to the left to be centered on the tile sprite, - this.tileSize * this.zoom
/ 2 and finally move to the right to take into account the size of the menu obscuring the viewport, + menuBarWidth;. The
Y position is a simplified calculation since there is no menu above the map to take into consideration. That’s all there
is to it! I’d be interested to know if anyone has any questions or suggestions for better ways to implement a Tilemap with
Pixi. I feel this method is fairly simple, expandable, and does a good job of integrating with library. Thanks for reading!
